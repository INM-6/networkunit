Concept
-------
The NetworkUnit module builds upon the formalized validation scheme of the SciUnit package,
which enables the validation of *models* against experimental data (or other models) via *tests*.
A test is matched to the model by *capabilities* and quantitatively evaluated by a *score*.
The following figure illustrates a typical test design within NetworkUnit.
The blue boxes indicate the components of the implementation of the validation test, i.e.,
classes, class instances, data sets, and parameters.
The relation between the boxes are indicated by annotated arrows.The basic functionality is
shown by green arrows.  The difference in the test design for comparing against experimental
data (validation) and  another  simulation  (substantiation)  is  indicated  by  yellow  and
red  arrows,  respectively.  The  relevant  functionality  of  some  components  for  the
computation  of  test  score  is  indicated  by  pseudo-code.  The  capability
class :py:`ProducesProperty` contains  the  function :py:`calc_property()`. The test :py:`XYTest` has a function
:py:`generate_prediction()` which makes use of this capability, inherited by the model class,
to generate a model prediction. The initialized test instance :py:`XYTest_paramZ` makes use of its
:py:`judge()` function to evaluate this model prediction and compute the score :py:`TestScore`.
The :py:`XYTest` can inherit from multiple abstract test classes (:py:`BaseTest`),
which is for example used with the :py:`M2MTest` to add the functionality of evaluating multiple model classes.
To make the test executable it has to be linked to a ScoreType and all free parameters need to be set
(by a :py:`Params` dict) to ensure a reproducible result.
